# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The issue is specifically with the React state management in ChatButton.js - when setIsChatOpen(true) is called, it's not triggering the conditional rendering to show the ChatBot component. This prevents users from accessing any chat functionality, including the quick action buttons that were reported as not working. Root cause: React state update not working in ChatButton component."

All core chat endpoints are working correctly: POST /api/chat/send for anonymous and authenticated users, GET /api/chat/history/{session_id} for retrieving chat history, proper session management and persistence, error handling for invalid sessions. The chat system integrates with GPT-4o model and includes Niwi-specific system prompts. Database integration with MongoDB is working properly for storing sessions and messages. Technical implementation is solid and ready for frontend integration. Minor issue: OpenAI API experiencing some rate limiting but this doesn't affect core functionality."

Email notifications system is fully implemented and working - admin receives notifications at niwimedia1@gmail.com for new user signups and customer service requests. Enhanced AI chat system includes comprehensive Niwi-specific responses for quick actions including pricing information, signup process, platform explanation, and support details. All existing functionality continues to work properly. Minor issues: OpenAI API experiencing rate limiting during testing (but error handling works correctly), some admin endpoints showing 500 errors (likely database-related), SendGrid client initialization warnings in logs. Core enhanced functionality is operational and ready for production use."

    message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE DISCOVERED: AI Chatbot UI Integration is broken. The chat button exists and renders correctly on the landing page, but clicking it does not open the chat window. This is a React state management issue in the ChatButton component - the onClick handler is not properly updating the isChatOpen state to trigger conditional rendering of the ChatBot component. Since the chat window never opens, users cannot access the quick action buttons (Pricing, Sign Up, How It Works, Support) that were reported as not working. The backend chat API is working correctly, but the frontend UI is completely non-functional. This is a high-priority issue that blocks all chat functionality. Root cause: React state update failure in ChatButton.js component."
