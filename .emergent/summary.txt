<product_requirements>
The Niwi platform, a dual-sided marketplace (professionals vs. customers), required transformation from a basic React/FastAPI app into a robust platform with a warm, inviting design akin to Inkris. Initial core features (admin, home, lead management, profile) were to be retained.

Key requirements evolved to include:
1.  **UI/UX:** Inkris-style scrolling, reactive buttons, and scroll animations on all pages. Later, these scrolling effects were removed, and luxury icons with optimized mobile typography were requested.
2.  **Monetization:** Stripe-based credit system allowing professionals to purchase leads; specific credit packages and Stripe links were provided and updated multiple times (e.g., Tester Pack from 10 to 3 leads, Enterprise from 100 to 200, Premium from 50 to 100).
3.  **Content/Structure:** Removal of a separate Leads tab, integration of a Dashboard, a Bark-style Profile page for professionals with tabs (About, Reviews, Q&A, Services), and a shortened Bark-like homepage with a customer service request search bar.
4.  **Mobile Responsiveness:** Crucial for all new and existing elements, addressing issues like cut-off buttons and cramped text.
5.  **User Flows:** Linking Edit Profile to the profile page, enabling profile picture, About section, and service selection editing for professionals, implementing a customer review system for professionals, creating a View All Leads page, and linking Contact Support to .
6.  **Dashboard Refinement:** Removal of category icons from both professional and admin dashboards.
7.  **Bug Fixes:** Repeated login failures for all user types were reported and fixed, as well as an incorrect step 3 icon (white circle instead of red).
