The previous AI engineer effectively transformed a basic React/FastAPI application into a comprehensive dual-sided marketplace named Niwi, fulfilling a complex set of product requirements. The trajectory shows a systematic approach, starting with codebase exploration, dependency installation, and initial setup verification. Key phases included robust backend development (data models, authentication, new API routes for professionals, customers, and credits), followed by a significant frontend overhaul to match the desired Inkris-like design with advanced UI elements.

Throughout the process, the AI engineer demonstrated iterative refinement and bug fixing. They addressed a login issue (though the user later reported it again implicitly), fixed incorrect Stripe payment links, and diligently tackled mobile responsiveness issues across various pages and components. The engineer consistently validated changes with screenshots and API calls, ensuring functionality and design adherence. The development workflow was clear: understand, plan, implement backend, implement frontend, test, and refine, directly responding to user feedback at each stage.

The user initially provided a partial codebase for a React frontend and FastAPI backend and requested to transform it into a fully functional website similar in design to . The target audience for the platform includes contractors, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, plumbers, and electricians. The core features present in the initial code (admin dashboard, admin login, home page, lead management, profile viewing) were all deemed important.

The application was named Niwi and was envisioned as a dual-sided marketplace. Its main value proposition needed to be inviting to both professionals seeking customers and individuals needing services. A warm, inviting color scheme, distinct from Inkris but with a similar aesthetic, was requested.

Subsequent refinements included:
1.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Implement Inkris-style scrolling effects, reactive buttons with hover/click states, and scroll-in/out animations on *every* page.
2.  **Payment System**: Integrate a Stripe-based credit system. Inquiries should be free for customers, but professionals must purchase credits to view job leads. Specific Stripe links for 7 credit packages were provided and later corrected.
3.  **Content and Structure**:
    *   Remove the Leads tab, as its functionality should be covered by the Dashboard.
    *   Create a Profile tab/page for professionals with a structure similar to .
    *   Update pricing packages to six specific tiers (Tester Pack, 777 Pack, Elite Pack, Pro Pack, Premium Deluxe, Enterprise Deluxe) with specified names and price points, linked to the provided Stripe checkout URLs.
4.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fix layout issues where buttons or text appeared cut off or cramped on phone screens, specifically noting issues with get started buttons and pricing cards.
5.  **Aesthetic Refinements**: Incorporate luxury icons for each section to enhance the rich feel and add a right-side scrolling font effect to the Why choose NiWi and Perfect for service professionals sections, ensuring all new elements are optimized for both mobile and desktop.

**High-level Architecture**:
The application follows a full-stack architecture, segregated into  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories. Data persistence is handled by MongoDB, and interactions with external services (Stripe) are managed through dedicated backend routes and webhooks. The frontend consumes the backend APIs for all dynamic data and user interactions.

**Detailed Directory Structure**:


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main entry point for the FastAPI backend application. It initializes the FastAPI app, adds CORS middleware, and includes all the defined API routers.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include new routers (, , , , ) by importing them from  and registering them with . The database connection setup (MongoDB) would implicitly be handled here or in a connected module.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the Pydantic models for data validation and serialization across the application. These models ensure data integrity for user, business, lead, and payment-related entities.
    -   **Changes Made**: Expanded to include new models for  (customers, professionals, admins), , , , , , , and . Ensures UUIDs are used instead of Mongo's ObjectID.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the core logic for user authentication, including password hashing (), JWT token creation (), and a dependency for extracting the current authenticated user ().
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit changes mentioned, but its logic supports the new user roles (professional, customer, admin) and JWT generation for all.

-   ** (directory)**:
    -   **Importance**: Organizes API endpoints into logical modules for better maintainability.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   ****: New file. Handles user registration and login for different user types.
        -   ****: New file. Manages professional user registration, business profile creation, and professional-specific lead browsing (now credit-gated). Modified to integrate credit deduction for lead viewing.
        -   ****: New file. Manages customer request submissions.
        -   ****: Existed, but updated to handle admin login and potentially lead distribution/management, replacing initial mock data.
        -   ****: New file. Handles credit package definitions, credit purchase initiation, and credit balance management.
        -   ****: New file. Implements the Stripe webhook handler for processing successful payments and updating user credit balances.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores sensitive environment variables like , , .
    -   **Changes Made**: Confirmed and potentially updated with  as needed by the Stripe integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that sets up client-side routing using  and wraps the application with .
    -   **Changes Made**: Routes were added for new pages: , , , , , , , , and . It also contained a duplicate export that was fixed.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the authentication state for the frontend, allowing components to access user login status and token.
    -   **Changes Made**: Handles login, logout, and token storage in . The logic for API calls was refined, especially concerning the  usage.

-   ** (directory)**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all the individual React pages of the application.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   ****: New file, became the primary public-facing page. Heavily modified to incorporate Inkris-style design, smooth scroll animations, reactive buttons, dynamic pricing section with Stripe links, and mobile responsiveness.
